## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://sign2communicate.vercel.app)

This part of the project is the server side part.

This project is part of the army projects that I built.
This project was requested by my recruiters that work with me and obviously I jumped on that project like a lion.
In this web application a user can sign in with his personal number and submit a signing request.
After that, the admin of the web application is checking if the request can be fulfilled, if it can so the admin will accept the request and will contact the requester later.
The user can see all of his requested signings and the admin can manage all of the signings that are available in the signings list page.
